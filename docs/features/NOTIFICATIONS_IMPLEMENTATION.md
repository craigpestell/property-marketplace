## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Toast System Architecture

```typescript

│   ├── Toast Components (Individual toasts)
│   └── Auto-dismiss Logic
├── useToast Hook
│   ├── showSuccess()
│   ├── showError()

```

### Real-Time Notification Flow

```
1. User Action (e.g., submit offer)
2. API creates offer + notification
3. SSE broadcasts to connected clients
4. useNotifications hook receives update
5. NotificationCenter updates UI
6. Toast notification shows (optional)
7. Database state synchronized
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Network Errors**: Toast notifications with retry options
- **API Errors**: Specific error messages from server
- **Authentication**: Proper auth state handling
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when SSE unavailable

## 🎯 User Flow Examples

### Offer Submission Flow

1. User fills out offer form
2. "Processing offer..." toast appears
3. Success: "Offer submitted!" toast + property owner gets notification
4. Error: Specific error toast + form stays open for retry

### Property Owner Notification Flow

1. New offer submitted
2. Real-time notification appears in notification center
3. Unread count updates in header
4. Optional: Toast notification for immediate awareness
5. Click notification to view details
